redmine_workflow_hidden_fields
==============================

This plugin adds a new 'Hidden' permission to the existing 'Read-only' and 'Required' permissions for issue fields, which are configurable per workflow.

Corresponding issue on redmine.org: [#12005](http://www.redmine.org/issues/12005)


###Features

- Configure hidden fields in workflows, thus per status and roles.

- Hidden fields don't show up for respective users on issues (views, table, forms, history), exported .csv and .pdf files.

- Completely hidden fields (fields that are configured to not be visible anywhere for the user) are removed from available columns & filters.

For using with version 2.6.5:

- Copy the directory **pdf/** located on **util/** to the path **<redmine_root_path>/lib/redmine/export/**
